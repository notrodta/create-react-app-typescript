# Create React App - TypeScript Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is based on the `tyepscript` template.

Besides the one test that's automatically provided in `src/App.test.tsx`, there are two additional tests on the remaining two elements rendered in the `<App />` component: the prompt (the text within the `<p />` element) and the logo (the `<img />` element).
